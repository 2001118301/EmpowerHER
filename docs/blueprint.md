## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, optimistic purple (#9D3CB5) symbolizing creativity and empowerment. This color provides a modern and engaging feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0). A subtle and clean backdrop to make content pop and maintain readability, working well with the purple primary color.
- Accent color: Teal (#30C4C4). To highlight important elements, providing a fresh, engaging contrast with the purple.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, offers a modern, objective, and neutral appearance.
- Use modern, minimalist icons. Icons should be custom-designed to be relevant to the content.
- A clean, grid-based layout, responsive across devices. Focus on a mobile-first design, optimizing for smaller screens, with a clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation.
- Subtle animations for user feedback, page transitions, and loading states. These should be used sparingly to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
